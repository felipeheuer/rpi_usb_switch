# Raspberry Pi controlled USB switch

This is a simple project that allows you to enable/disable power lines from 5 USB ports individually over 5 GPIO's from a Raspberry Pi.

Was initially made to re-use an old dead USB hub that was laying down on my drawers an recycle it into a nice hub for powering up my LED gadgets.
The Mosfet circuitry layout is based on a generic circuit found on Amazon from different brands, but might have [this guy](https://michiel.vanderwulp.be/domotica/Modules/MosFetPwmDriveModule/) as a father.

**Data lines are disabled, this is only used for devices that have USB port as power source.**
